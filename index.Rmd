# What is Landsat 8?

.pull-left[

* a US satellite launched in February 11, 2013

* has two senors:
  * Operational Land Imager (OLI)
  * Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS)
  
* orbit: polar, sun-synchronous

* altitude: 705 km

* managed by NASA and the US Geological Survey (USGS)

* to collect imagery used for observing and managing the Earth’s resources

# Case study: water use mapping in the Colorado River Basin

* Mapping evapotranspiration by using Landsat data in spatial resolution with 100 meters
* Found croplands is the largest consumer of managed surface and ground water and shrublands
is the largest consumer of natural rainfall and soil moisture
* Further studies can be identified and recorded water footprints of different fields using historical Landsat data

# Reflection on Landsat 8 data 
* Landsat 8 has OLI sensor and TIRS sensor, including 11 bands, and the applications of them are useful:

  * band 1 (OLI) for coastal studies
  * band 2 (OLI) for distinguishing deciduous from coniferous vegetation
  * band 4 (OLI) for identifying vegetation slopes
  * band 9 (OLI) for detection of cirrus
  * band 10 and 11 (TIRS) for thermal mapping
  
* Landsat data can be used through temporal aspect.

 * analyzing the dynamics of canopy cover between 1990 and 2020.
 
* Landsat data can be utilized in machine learning techniques such as deep learning for image classification, object detection and etc.

# Reflection on how to use it in my work
* The thermal data will be a good source for me to explore the temperature variables in my study, like exploring the thermal inequality in different race groups. 

* The visualization of data are informative for me to find some potential trends, like potential direction of development for urban area.

* The data also can be a applied in some further studies that are related to forest management, climate change, agriculture and natural resources management, and etc.
